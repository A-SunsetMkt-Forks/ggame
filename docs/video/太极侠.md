## 来自大陆的审查

拍摄取消了一些暴力的镜头，将 11 次对头部的攻击减少至 5 次。地点从大陆变更至香港，因为大陆没有地下格斗场与腐败的警察。

> **George Stroumboplis:** I know guys that made films there, and maybe you didn't have this experience, but making a film in China you had to deal with the government and there was censorship and there was all these other issues. Did you have to go through that process?
> 
> **Keanu Reeves**: Absolutely. They don't have a ratings system in mainland China. So the idea is films have to be able to be seen by all ages. So there's no PG-13 or R or anything like that. And then there's content. Obviously the censorship has content issues.

> I had to take down some of the violence. So I had one sequence where the lead punched someone in the head 11 times ... so we made it five. And that was OK. It got the story across ... and then another one was 32 and that went to 17.

> In the film I have underground fighting. So they didn't want underground fighting in mainland China, in the capital of China. So in Beijing there's no underground fighting. And there's no corrupt police officers. So we had to go to Hong Kong ... because it's OK in Hong Kong."[^wkrpuwcc]
