## 简介

Dirty Chinese Restaurant 是 Big-O-Tree Games 打算于 2017 年推出的手机游戏。

> [!quote]+ GAME DESCRIPTION[^pk]
>
> Dirty Chinese Restaurant is the first ever restaurant simulation where you have the choice of running a prestigious Oriental establishment or a real filthy dive!
>
> You assume the role of Wong Fu, who has just inherited his brother Wang Fu’s business. As Wong Fu, you must ensure your top-notch eatery is always fully stocked with fresh provisions, has its bills paid, equipped with the most dedicated and hardworking staff, and is on its way to making the family business a wholesome household name in the community. But how you pull off those feats, well that’s your call!
>
> Play through eight electrifying chapters to unfold Wong Fu’s flame-broiling, veggie-pounding, meat-slicing exploits as he commandeers his flagship enterprise. Scour the back alleys as you seek out ‘depreciated’ ingredients for you latest entrée.
>
> You have the choice of running a top rate eatery by complimenting customers, slashing discounts on meals, and bestowing gracious compensation on your plucky laborers. But, should you feel the need to raise some ruckus, you can insult your patrons, sabotage the competition, and pay your staff in degradingly frugal minimum wages.
>
> But be forewarned! With the balancing scales of the Karma System, no bad deed goes unpunished. Keep an eye on the Karma Bar as it’s keeping a very watchful eye on you.
>
> Get your finger tips dirty on your iOS an Android devices coming soon!
