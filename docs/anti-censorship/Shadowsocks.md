## 作者删库

2015年8月22日，Shadowsocks 作者 clowwindy 清空了自己所有的仓库历史记录，只在仓库的 README.md 文件中留下了「Removed according to regulations.」这句话。[^clr]

[^clr]: + [GitHub - shadowsocks/shadowsocks](https://web.archive.org/web/20211016182935/https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks)
    + [GitHub - clowwindy/ShadowVPN: Removed according to regulations.](https://web.archive.org/web/20210125042808/https://github.com/clowwindy/ShadowVPN)
    + [GitHub - clowwindy/ShadowVPN-iOS: Removed according to regulations.](https://web.archive.org/web/20201224085422/https://github.com/clowwindy/ShadowVPN-iOS)

在清空仓库之前，作者在 Issues 里发文:

> Two days ago the police came to me and wanted me to stop working on this. Today they asked me to delete all the code from GitHub. I have no choice but to obey.
>
> I hope one day I'll live in a country where I have freedom to write any code I like without fearing.
>
> I believe you guys will make great stuff with Network Extensions.
>
> Cheers![^124]
